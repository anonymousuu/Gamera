# GremlinChecker

GremlinChecker is the component of Gamera for finding logic bugs in Gremlin-based Graph Database Systems (GDBs).

## Getting Started

1. Requirements
- Java 8
- Maven 3 (e.g., Maven 3.8.6)
- Operating System: Mac, Linux

2. GremlinChecker takes [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org), [TinkerGraph](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/tinkergraph), [HugeGraph](https://hugegraph.github.io/hugegraph-doc/), [OrientDB](http://orientdb.org/) and [ArcadeDB](https://arcadedb.com/) as examples to detect logic bugs.

3. The `log*` directory stores information related to the detected logic bugs and reproducible test cases.
